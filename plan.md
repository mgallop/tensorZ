substantive question
===

* how can we understand what global trade patterns look like, in the presence of a china that is more active in africa

	- that speaks to the importance of the network context, just understanding bilateral trade stuff does not get you that far

	- counterfactual with africa: what happens if africa became more active, even if each african country grew only 10\% over the next couple of years, what predictions would we make

	- does this speak to what countries are most likely to engate in disputes at the WTO

* complicated interdependencies in the world...milner 

* kantian triad...endogenous

dyadic trade model: 
===

* monadic covariates:

	- polity of both countries, gathered monthly level scores from CRISP

	- gdp of both countries, gathered from World Bank in constant 2005 US dollars

	- population of both countries

	- spatial distance trade variable, created by weighting trade with distance measures from cshapes

	- wto membership
		+ no point in collecting, most all countries gained entry into the WTO on the same date
		+ https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm

* dyadic disputes: 

	- alliance, gathered from COW

	- geographic proximity, gathered from cshapes

	- verbal conflict/material conflict

model formulation: 
===

* mltr 

* additive approach

other todos:
===

* set up the four quad variables at the monthly level for all the countries and then include the quad variables for the domestic within each country

* the cross-sections should be populated by domestic events
