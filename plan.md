substantive question
===

* how can we understand what global trade patterns look like, in the presence of a china that is more active in africa

	+ that speaks to the importance of the network context, just understanding bilateral trade stuff does not get you that far

	+ counterfactual with africa: what happens if africa became more active, even if each african country grew only 10\% over the next couple of years, what predictions would we make

	+ does this speak to what countries are most likely to engate in disputes at the WTO

* complicated interdependencies in the world...milner 

* kantian triad...endogenous

dyadic trade model: 
===

* monadic covariates:

	+ polity of both countries

	+ gdp of both countries

	+ population of both countries

	+ spatial distance trade variable

	+ wto membership

* dyadic disputes: 

	+ alliance

		- ATOP instead of COW

	+ geographic proximity

	+ verbal conflict/material conflict

model formulation: 
===

* mltr 

* additive approach

other todos:
===

* set up the four quad variables at the monthly level for all the countries and then include the quad variables for the domestic within each country

* the cross-sections should be populated by domestic events
